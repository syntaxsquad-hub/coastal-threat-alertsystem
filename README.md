> Real-time wave, storm surge, and coastal flooding monitoring with ML-driven threat detection and multi‑channel alerting.

## Introduction
Coastal Threat Alert System provides a unified service that continuously ingests oceanographic and meteorological data (e.g., wave height, tide, wind, pressure) from sensors and APIs, analyzes risk in real time, and issues timely alerts to communities and stakeholders. Its purpose is to monitor coastal threats like storm surges, flooding, and high‑wind events; integrate diverse data sources; and help communities prepare and respond.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of wave height, storm surge, wind, tide, and precipitation
- Automated threat detection with configurable thresholds and models
- Alert generation and notification via e‑mail, SMS, and in‑app dashboard
- Interactive web dashboard for live maps, timelines, and drill‑downs
- Modular architecture for easy extension (new sensors, regions, rules)
- Support for multiple regions and heterogeneous data sources

## Tech Stack
Modular React frontend built with Vite, featuring centralized state management and screen-based navigation.

## Available Scripts
